                            Haiku Icon Theme

This is a Haiku icon theme based on https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1012423.

All icons are .svg files in the svg/ directory.  The Makefile, the
'build' script and other data files are used to build the icon theme
directory 'Haiku/'.  They convert the svg files into png (when building
a fixed size icon set), copy the files (according to the 'files' file)
and create the symbolic links (according to the 'links' file).

To build the theme for a scalable size icon set, run the following
command:

	make scalable

To build the theme for a 64x64 size icon set, run the following command:

	make 64x64

To build the theme for all sizes (scalable, 64x64, 32x32, etc), run
the following command:

	make

To install, copy the created directory 'Haiku' into the icon theme
directory.
